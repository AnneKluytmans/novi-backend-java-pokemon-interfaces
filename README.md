# PokÃ©mon Battle Simulator â€“ NOVI Backend Java Assignment

## About the Project

This repository contains my implementation of the **PokÃ©mon Battle Simulator** assignment for the Backend Java module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).  
The goal of this assignment is to collaboratively complete a partially built game engine by implementing all missing classes, interfaces, and logic based on a predefined set of rules and requirements.

This assignment focuses on using **abstraction**, **inheritance**, **interfaces**, and **decision structures** to create a turn-based PokÃ©mon battle system with type-based attack behavior and health logic.

## Key Features

- ðŸ”¥ `FirePokemon`, ðŸŒŠ `WaterPokemon`, ðŸŒ¿ `GrassPokemon`, âš¡ `ElectricPokemon`
- Type effectiveness system (fire > grass, grass > electric, etc.)
- Abstract base `Pokemon` class with shared properties, HP handling, and standard behavior
- Interface with 11 attack methods (e.g., `leafStorm`, `rainDance`, `thunder`, `leechSeed`)
- `PokemonGymImpl` class as game engine â€” left untouched except for imports
- Attacks print battle logs and update HP based on type matchups
- HP boost or transfer mechanics in certain attacks (e.g., `leechSeed`)
- Guard clauses to prevent PokÃ©mon with 0 HP from acting
- A food variable and feeding mechanics to boost HP
- Game loop checks PokÃ©mon health before executing actions â†’ PokÃ©mon with 0 HP are deactivated and cannot attack
